  <h1>Hey! You found me.</h2>
  <br />

  <p>I&rsquo;m Chris Wetherill, a Midwestern kid working on fun data-related things at State Auto Insurance Companies. Here, I lead our data science team and am responsible for developing partnerships and strategic collaborations with other analytic groups across the company.</p>
  
  <p>Previously, I was at SafeAuto Insurance where I was the founding and lead member of their Data &amp; Decision Science team. There, I led pilot programs to evaluate new and emerging technologies and partnered with business stakeholders to develop and implement new predictive models. Following this, I transitioned to a technical lead role on our Product R&amp;D team where I investigated ways to improve customer segmentation in our rating algorithm and led the development of new underwriting models.</p>
    
  <p>Prior to this, I was working my way through a PhD program in computational biology at Virginia Tech. We did some work at the intersection of genomics and epidemiolgy, trying to better predict how diseases move through populations.</p>

  <p>Every now and then, I&rsquo;ll even feel super motivated and make some contributions on <a href="https://phabricator.tbmh.org">Phabricator</a>. Right now I&rsquo;m working on Cast, a cluster management utility that&rsquo;s arguably slightly better than running SSH in a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

  <br />

  <p>Some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve worked on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://phabricator.tbmh.org/diffusion/CAST/">Cast</a>: A cluster management utility for wrecking more servers even faster.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/faulconbridge/invino">Invino</a>: A wine recommendation engine based on science, not sommeliers.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/infoactive/data-design">Data + Design</a>: A book aimed at journalists on how to responsibly present and visualize data. I edited this before alternative facts really came into their own.</li>
  </ul>

                    <h2>Woah, where am I?</h2>
                    <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by to find out a little bit about me. I'm not usually very interesting to creep on, but I do my best.</p>
                    <p>I'm Chris Wetherill, a Midwestern kid studying cognitive and computational neuroscience-y things (first at <a href="http://sites.jcu.edu/psychology" target="_blank">John Carroll University</a> in Cleveland and now at <a href="http://www.tbmh.vt.edu" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>). On occasion I'm also an amateur <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEjKk5Kt3rs" target="_blank">cat yodeler</a>.</p>
                    <p>There's not much to see, but feel free to poke around. I think it goes without saying, but the random quotes in each page footer aren't serious. You won't really contract a rare disease. (Or at least not that I know of.) Some are rather morbid, though. Apologies for those.</p>
    
                    <p>Peace!</p>

                        <h2>What's cool around here?</h2>
                        
                        <p>Well, there's not much cool to see here, but if you have an interest in statistics, neuroscience, etc., here are some linkouts that might be fun for you to browse:</p>
                        <table class="recs">
                            <tr>
                                <td>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> and <a href="http://www.rstudio.com" target="_blank">RStudio</a> &mdash; Both obligatory and (hopefully) unnecessary. If you have an interest in applied statistics, R is a great place to start. It's powerful and open source, but it does have a learning curve. There are some great resources (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP" target="_blank">A 'get started' video series</a> from Google; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins courses</a> on data analysis via Coursera) online to get you going if you don't know where to start.</li>
                                        <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/" target="_blank">/r/statistics</a> &mdash; The Statistics subreddit has usually got some good conversations going. Well, at least occasionally. Check out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/opendata" target="_blank">/r/opendata</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rstats" target="_blank">/r/rstats</a> as well if you're bored.</li>

                                        <li><a href="http://book.openingscience.org/" target="_blank">Opening Science</a> &mdash; This book provides an overview of the emergence and future of open science and the various schools of thought that comprise the ideal. It's a good resource if you're new to open science/data/access/etc. and want to learn more or become involved.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li><a href="http://www.data.gov" target="_blank">data.gov</a> &mdash; Bored? Check out some of the thousands of governmental data sets that are published here. Great for a side project if you find a topic that's up your alley!</li>
                                        <li><a href="https://github.com/datasets" target="_blank">GitHub Datasets</a> &mdash; Just a good resource for some generic datasets to play around with. It's a good resource if you just want more experience dealing with data 'in the wild' (although these datasets are cleaner than a lot of what you'll find elsewhere).</li>
										<li><a href="http://driven-by-data.net/" target="_blank">Driven By Data</a> &mdash; The personal website of Gregor Aisch, a graphics editor at the New York <em>Times</em>. He writes up some great posts on visualizing data and is well worth checking out.</li>

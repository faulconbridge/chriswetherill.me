  <h1>Hey! You found me.</h2>
  <br />

  <p>I'm Chris Wetherill, a Midwestern kid working on fun data-related things at SafeAuto. I founded and currently lead our Data & Decision Science team: we do stuff somewhere between data engineering, machine learning, and software engineering, but are generally focused on modernizing how SafeAuto consumes, interprets, and acts on data. Mostly this is just an excuse to do cool things like build self-service analytics tools or design and stand up a Hadoop cluster. Saying it out loud, though, maybe I need better hobbies...</p>

  <p>Prior to this, I was working my way through a PhD program in computational biology at Virginia Tech. We did some cool work at the intersection of genomics and epidemiolgy, trying to better predict how diseases move through populations.</p>

  <p>Every now and then, I'll even feel super motivated and make some contributions on <a href="https://github.com/faulconbridge">GitHub</a>. Right now I'm working on Cast, a cluster management utility that's arguably slightly better than running SSH in a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

  <p>Wanna chat about data? Feel free to <a href="mailto:chris@tbmh.org">get in touch!</a></p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <br />

  <p>Some of the stuff I've worked on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/faulconbridge/cast">Cast</a>: A cluster management utility for wrecking more servers even faster.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Vervidium/vervidium">Vervidium</a>: A platform for data science and self-service analytics.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/infoactive/data-design">Data + Design</a>: A book aimed at journalists on how to responsibly present and visualize data. I edited this before alternative facts really came into fashion.</li>
  </ul>

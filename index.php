  <h1>Hey! You found me.</h2>
  <br />

  <p>I&rsquo;m Chris Wetherill, a Midwestern kid working on fun data-related things at SafeAuto. I started off as the inaugural member of our Data &amp; Decision Science team and am currently the lead data scientist on our R&amp;D team. We do stuff somewhere in the neighborhood of data engineering, machine learning, and software engineering, but are generally focused on modernizing how SafeAuto consumes, interprets, and acts on data.</p>
  
  <p>Or, you know, we sell auto insurance.</p>
  
  <p>Mostly this is just an excuse for us to do cool things like build self-service analytics tools, dig into machine learning algorithms, find new and exciting ways to quanatify risk, and maybe develop an API here or there. It&rsquo;s a hoot.</p>

  <p>Prior to this, I was working my way through a PhD program in computational biology at Virginia Tech. We did some work at the intersection of genomics and epidemiolgy, trying to better predict how diseases move through populations.</p>

  <p>Every now and then, I&rsquo;ll even feel super motivated and make some contributions on <a href="https://github.com/faulconbridge">GitHub</a>. Right now I&rsquo;m working on Cast, a cluster management utility that&rsquo;s arguably slightly better than running SSH in a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <br />

  <p>Some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve worked on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/faulconbridge/cast">Cast</a>: A cluster management utility for wrecking more servers even faster.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/faulconbridge/invino">Invino</a>: A wine recommendation engine based on science, not sommeliers.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/infoactive/data-design">Data + Design</a>: A book aimed at journalists on how to responsibly present and visualize data. I edited this before alternative facts really came into their own.</li>
  </ul>

	<h2>SQL Alias</h2>
	<p>So all of the columns that you include in the SELECT statement are automatically included in the output here. But sometimes they're ugly. Like, what's LgSUBTLWF even mean? Honestly...</p>
	<p>Point is, you can use an alias (signified with an AS in your SELECT statement) to rename the column as displayed in the output.</p>
	<h2>SQL Alias Syntax</h2>
	<code>SELECT column_name AS alias</code><br />
	<code>FROM table_name</code><br />
	<code>WHERE column_name operator value</code><br />
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<code>SELECT LENGTH, AVG(LgSUBTLWF) AS AVG_FREQ FROM ELP GROUP BY LENGTH</code><br />
	<P>This query will output the column headers</p>
	<code>LENGTH, AVG_FREQ</code>
	<p>instead of</p>
	<code>LENGTH, AVG(LgSUBTLWF)</code>

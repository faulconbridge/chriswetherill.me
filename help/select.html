	<h2>SQL SELECT Statement</h2>
	<p>
		The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The result is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
	</p>
	<p>
		SELECT specifies the columns from which you would like data returned. All column names that can be passed through a SELECT statement in the ELP database are listed to the left under <strong>ELP</strong>.

	<h2>SQL SELECT Syntax</h2>
	<code>SELECT column_name(s)</code><br />
	<code>FROM table_name</code>
	<p>and</p>
	<code>SELECT * FROM table_name</code><br />
	<dfn>Note: SQL is not case sensitive. SELECT is the same as select.</dfn>

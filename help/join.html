	<h2>SQL JOIN Statement</h2>
	<p>SQL joins are used to query data from two or more tables, based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.</p>
	<p>The JOIN keyword is used in an SQL statement to query data from two or more tables, based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.</p>
	<p>Tables in a database are often related to each other with keys.</p>
	<p>A primary key is a column (or a combination of columns) with a unique value for each row. Each primary key value must be unique within the table. The purpose is to bind data together, across tables, without repeating all of the data in every table.</p>
	<p>Before we continue with examples, we will list the types of JOIN you can use, and the differences between them.

		<ul>
			<li><strong>JOIN</strong>: Return rows when there is at least one match in both tables</li>
			<li><strong>LEFT JOIN</strong>: Return all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table</li>
			<li><strong>RIGHT JOIN</strong>: Return all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table</li>
			<li><strong>FULL JOIN</strong>: Return rows when there is a match in one of the tables</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>SQL JOIN Syntax</h2>
	<code>SELECT column_name(s)</code><br />
	<code>FROM table1</code><br />
	<code>RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.ColName1 = table2.Colname2</code><br />
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<p>
		Okay, so this is actually a kind of nontrivial example and is overkill for a simple example. But whatevs. Let's say we want a word list that:
		<ul>
			<li>Includes the cue, cue log frequency, cuePOS, target, target log frequency, number of P responses for each cue, and the number of P responses for each target;</li>
			<li>Only returns values with measured log frequencies;</li>
			<li>Only returns homographs;</li>
			<li>Only returns cues whose log frequency is 1.5 < x < 2.8;</li>
			<li>Only returns cues that can be BOTH nouns and verbs;</li>
			<li>Is returned in alphabetical order by target word</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>That's a whole lot of craziness, but you still following? So, basically, these data that we want reside in two separate tables: ELP has some characteristics (like log freq) and USF has others (like targets and a homograph marker). However, we can functionally combine these tables with a JOIN statement. Here we use two: one joing ELP.WORD and USF.CUE; the other joining ELP.WORD and USF.TARGET. But wait, how can we do that? We can't combine three variables like that, can we? Well, we kind of can. Basically, with the aliases and some other magic we're keeping the two joins independent of one another. So think of it as though we took ELP and cloned it. So now we have ELP1 and ELP2. We join ELP1 along ELP.WORD = USF.CUE and we join ELP2 along ELP.WORD = USF.TARGET. Pretty darned close to functionally independent of one another, right?</p> <br />
	<code>SELECT e1.WORD as Cue, e1.LgSUBTLWF as word_frq,</code><br />
	<code>e1.POS, u1.TARGET, e2.LgSUBTLWF as tgt_freq, u1.SAMPLE, u1.N</code><br />
	<code>FROM USF u1</code><br />
	<code>RIGHT JOIN ELP e1 ON (u1.CUE = e1.WORD)</code><br />
	<code>RIGHT JOIN ELP e2 ON (u1.target = e2.word)</code><br />
	<code>WHERE e1.LgSUBTLWF is NOT NULL AND u1.CueHomograph is NOT NULL</code><br />
	<code>AND (e1.POS='NN|VB' OR e1.POS='VB|NN') AND e1.LgSUBTLWF>1.5</code><br />
	<code>AND e1.LgSUBTLWF>2.8 AND e1.LENGTH>3 AND e1.LENGTH<7</code><br />
	<code>GROUP BY u1.TARGET</code><br />
	<code>ORDER BY e1.WORD ASC </code><br /><br />

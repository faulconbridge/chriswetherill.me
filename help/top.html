	<h2>SQL TOP Clause</h2>
	<p>The TOP clause allows you to specify the number of records that you would like returned by your query.
	</p>
	<h2>SQL SELECT TOP Syntax</h2>
	<code>SELECT TOP number|percent column_name</code><br />
	<code>FROM table_name</code><br />
	<code>WHERE column_name operator value</code><br />
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<p>
		Let's say we want the average LgSUBTLWF for words, grouped by length. (That is, the average for len=2, len=3, ... , len=n) But now we only want the five highest averages:
	</p>
	<code>SELECT TOP 5 LENGTH, AVG(LgSUBTLWF) FROM ELP</code><br />
	<code>GROUP BY LENGTH ORDER BY AVG(LgSUBTLWF) DESC</code><br />
	<P>Please note, at present, this database doesn't like TOP clauses. I'll figure out why at some point, but at the moment, it's not something you can operate on.</p>

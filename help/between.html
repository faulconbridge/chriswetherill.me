	<h2>SQL BETWEEN Operator</h2>
	<p>The BETWEEN operator is a quick and easy way to select only rows that have a column falling within a certain range of values. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive (at least in this database). It can be used with strings, dates, and numbers.</p>
	<h2>SQL BETWEEN Syntax</h2>
	<code>SELECT column_name</code><br />
	<code>FROM table_name</code><br />
	<code>WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2</code><br />
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<p>Say we wanted all words with a length between 1 and 4:</p>
	<code>SELECT WORD, LENGTH, LgSUBTLWF FROM ELP</code><br />
	<code>WHERE LENGTH BETWEEN 1 AND 4</code>

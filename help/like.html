	<h2>SQL LIKE Operator</h2>
	<p>The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to specify a pattern along which to constrain the results that are returned. The percent sign (%) is used here as a wildcard for multiple characters. For a single character wildcard, use the underscore (_).
	</p>
	<h2>SQL LIKE Syntax</h2>
	<code>SELECT column_name(s)</code><br />
	<code>FROM table_name</code><br />
	<code>WHERE column_name liKE 'value'</code><br />
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<p>
		Let's build on our previous example. Say your last query was too restrictive and instead of words that are <em>only</em> nouns, maybe you would like to have all words that can have noun forms (among others). Your query qould look something like,
	</p>
	<code>SELECT WORD, POS FROM ELP WHERE POS LIKE '%NN%'</code>

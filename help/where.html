	<h2>SQL WHERE CLAUSE</h2>
	<p>The WHERE clause is used to restrict the results returned to only those that meet certain specified criteria. You can use =, >, and < in a WHERE clause.
	</p>
	<h2>SQL WHERE Syntax</h2>
	<code>SELECT column_name(s)</code><br />
	<code>FROM table_name</code><br />
	<code>WHERE column_name operator 'value'</code><br />
	<h4>Explanation</h4>
	<p>
		WHERE specifies the constraints that you want to place on the values returned. If the column you're restricting along contains strings, it will look like,
	</p>
	<code>SELECT WORD, POS FROM ELP WHERE POS='NN'</code>
	<p>
		However, if you're restricting along an integer, your statement will look like,
	</p>
	<code>SELECT LENGTH FROM ELP WHERE LENGTH=5</code>
